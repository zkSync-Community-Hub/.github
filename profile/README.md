➡️ **Abstract**  
➡️ **Cronos zkEVM**  
➡️ **GRVT**  
➡️ **Sophon**  
➡️ **Treasure**  
➡️ **Zero Network**  

### **🔜 Upcoming Chains**  
🔜 **Creator**  
🔜 **Memento**  
🔜 **Space & Time**  
🔜 **PlayChain**  
🔜 **Lens**  
🔜 **ZKCandy**  
🔜 **zkLighter**  
🔜 **zkXPLA**  

Developers can **build, deploy, and scale applications seamlessly** across the Elastic Network, leveraging the power of **zero-knowledge proofs and interoperability**.
